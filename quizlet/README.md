## Stealing correct answers
 There is a 100% working method for that.
 - Download any browser that is supporting add-ons (on mobile I recommend Firefox)
- Download and install Tampermonkey [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)] [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)]
- Install stealer.user.js in Tampermonkey by clicking [[This button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PetrusTryb/school-hacks/main/quizlet/stealer.user.js)]
- Go to https://quizlet.com/live, enter Your game code in both PIN input boxes.
- After each round starts, click "obtain correct answers". Correct answers will pop-op in the corner and be automatically clicked for You!

## Stealing others' answers
Not checked because there are methods to steal correct answers.

## Bypassing anti-cheat
There is no anti-cheat on Quizlet.

## Extending time to solve
Not checked because there is a working correct answers stealer. The leaderboard is based also on time, so it's in Your interest to solve the quiz as fast as You can.

## Spamming and flooding
Very easy, no captcha. There is a bot for flooding: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PetrusTryb/school-hacks/main/quizlet/spam.py
