## Stealing correct answers
 The best way is to use somebody's game session (or join game with second account).
 - Download any browser that is supporting add-ons (on mobile I recommend Firefox)
- Download and install Tampermonkey [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)] [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)]
- Install stealer.user.js in Tampermonkey by clicking [[This button](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PetrusTryb/school-hacks/main/quizizz/stealer.user.js)]
- Go to https://quizizz.com/join, join the game and enter name of any another player that is also in game (he/she will be probably unable to check answers because of this bot, so select carefully or enter the game in second, Incognito window).
- When the game starts, correct answers will be highlighted for You, just click!
